    <p>Last summer, I took a road trip from Seattle to San Francisco. Started with the Space Needle in Seattle, drove down the Pacific Coast Highway for amazing views, hit Olympic National Park's forests and lakes. Portland was all about good food and a chill atmosphere. Crater Lake was stunning, and San Francisco wrapped it up with the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a fun trip with lots of cool sights.</p>

    <h3>My Favorite Restaurant</h3>
    <p>My favorite resurant is Goldburgers in Newington, CT: <a href="https://www.goldburgers.com/" target="_blank">goldburgers.com </a>
    </p>
    <p>It is a local resturant to me, and are my top pick for a simple reason â€“ they serve the best burgers in town. The menu is stacked with mouthwatering options, from classic cheeseburgers to inventive specials that never disappoint. The friendly staff and cozy atmosphere make it feel like a second home, and the place buzzes with a sense of community. It's not just about the food; it's the perfect blend of great flavors and a laid-back vibe that keeps me coming back for more. It's not just a restaurant; it's my go-to spot for a reliably delicious meal and a chill atmosphere.

    <h3>My Favorite Food</h3>
    <img src='images/Pepperoni_Pizza.jpg' align='left' height="300">
    <p>I'm a pepperoni pizza enthusiast through and through. I like it hot and fresh out of the oven, with that perfect balance of gooey cheese and crispy crust. I'm all about the classic - a generous layer of pepperoni that crisps up at the edges. No frills, just a straightforward slice that I can fold in half for that satisfying bite. Whether it's a solo meal or a gathering with friends, a box of pepperoni pizza is my go-to, and I savor every cheesy, savory moment.</p>
