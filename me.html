    <h1>Casey O</h1>
    <div>I wanted to take CS120 to learn how to do web programming, and generally how the web works. One of my goals is to make a portfolio site for my resume, and to make it look professionally done. I am an intermediate programmer - I have a background in mechanical engineering, so I originally learned it in an engineering context, but since then I have taken a few CS classes related to it and built my proficiency - my main languages are python and C++.</div>
